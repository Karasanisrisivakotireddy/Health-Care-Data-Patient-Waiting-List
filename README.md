This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and monitor patient wait lists across different case types, specialties, age groups, and time periods. It provides a clear overview of total wait lists, monthly trends, age-wise distribution, and top specialties with the highest waiting patients. The dashboard includes dynamic filters, average/median comparisons, and drill-down capabilities to help identify patterns, bottlenecks, and areas needing attention. This project was built for learning and portfolio purposes, focusing on real-world healthcare analytics, data visualization, and dashboard storytelling using Power BI.
